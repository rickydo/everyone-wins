I will create a Trello board to this project for user stories and to show progress of the project. 

Initially I'm going to be building this project as a heroku web app with the thought that not everyone in a 3rd world country 
may possess a mobile phone. Access to a public computer is more likely. 

The MVP of this project is to allow users to register into the program. They are then required to pay a small amount of money to
the pot. At the beginning of every week a single person is given the pot to help pay whatever expenses they may have. 
Everyone should have the opportunity to take the pot home. New users will be the last to win (meaning all the users participating in the program before 
the new user will "win" before the new user(s))

Some thoughts that come to mind first are, should the "winners" be selected by random? or by the date the user joins? 
Pros/Cons from what I think the perspective of a third world resident struggling to eat/drink/pay for medical expenses/surprise expenses 
would consider are below.

Pros for random selection of "winner":
-don't have to wait to receive the pot in a specific user order

Cons for random selection of "winner":
-users will not know when they will receive the pot
-users cannot plan or budget in advance of their pot earnings
-users may not trust the system if chosen randomly (it may be frustrating to always wait for the pot but not selected for the week)

The weight of the cons have influenced me to choose a "winner" by join date. 

Afterwards I plan to build out an API so I can use it with an Android device.
